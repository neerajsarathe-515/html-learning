			<h3><b>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</b></h3>
			<br>
			Dear Eileen,<br>
			<br>			
			<p>Thank you for the recent application join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, the following sections.<p>
			<br>
			<h3>Starting Dates</h3>
			<br>
			<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time , however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one as follows:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>First Semester:<time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>

			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>As tbe Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-mind research faculty -- as long as the subjects fall somwhere in realm of science and technology. You seems like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you were submitted you were most intrigued by are  as follows, in order of priority:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Turing H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resvertrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
				<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temparature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3X10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3X10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
				3.<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.
			</ol>	
			<p>So please can you provide some more information on these subjects, including how long you'd expect research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you'd need to know? Thanks<p>
			<br>
			<h3>Exotic Dance Moves</h3>
			<p> Yes you are right! As a part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dance. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Polyneisan chicken dance</dt>
				<dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
				<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance is inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
				<dd>An interesting example of historic information, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they are really cold.</dd>
